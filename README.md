Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm that deals with data streams and the propagation of change. This means that when a data stream is updated, all components that are subscribed to that stream will be updated as well.

Some common tools and practices used for Reactive Programming include:

• Functional programming
• Event-driven programming
• Data flow programming
• The Observer pattern

JasperReports is a reporting tool that helps you to create detailed reports, charts, and graphs. It can be used to create both static and dynamic reports. static reports are those that are created once and do not change, whereas dynamic reports are those that can be created on-demand and are based on changing data.

JasperReports can be used with Reactive Programming to generate dynamic reports. The JasperReports library provides a set of Java classes that can be used to create reports. To use JasperReports with Reactive Programming, you need to first create a DataSource object that represents the data you want to use in your report. Then, you can create a JasperReport object and pass in the DataSource object as a parameter. Finally, you can call the JasperReport object's fillReport() method to generate the report.
